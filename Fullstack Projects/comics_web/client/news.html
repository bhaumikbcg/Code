          <h2>Spiderman comes back</h2>
      <p>
          Starting in June, hang out with Spider-Man as he leaps into a brand new story from Infinite Comics!
          Follow Peter Parker as he joins forces with Iron Man, Squirrel Girl, and more in this weekly 10-part series!

          Teasing the adventure to come, Associate Editor Devin Lewis says, “Set in the animated world of ‘Ultimate Spider-Man,’
          this Infinite Comics series explores Spider-Man’s life outside of the classroom—and outside of his adventures across
          the Spider-Verse and against the Sinister Six! He’ll cross paths with classic Marvel villains like Boomerang,
          and team-up with Marvel legends like Iron Man. We’ve got a few tricks up our sleeves that I can’t spoil,
          but what I can tell you is that readers should expect Spider-Man stories told in the Mighty Marvel Manner!”

          <h2>Daredevil VS Punisher</h2>
          <p>
              As  two largely street-level vigilantes, Daredevil and Punisher share an undeniable bond marked by a
              strange kind of sense of camaraderie, feelings of disappointment and even
              “there but for the grace of God go I” ruminations.

              When it comes to Daredevil, one can understand his revulsion at the Punisher’s methods right off.
              Punisher goes too far; Punisher does not merely push the law, he shatters it.
              But Matt Murdock also has a bleeding heart. He knows Frank Castle’s tragic story and cannot help
              but empathize with a life derailed by violence, a family eliminated by crime.

              For Punisher, on the other hand, Daredevil offers a band aid when the world needs an amputation.
              Nonetheless, Frank respects Matt. He might find his morals naïve or silly,
              but he recognizes Daredevil’s commitment to them and how that commitment holds back the gallons of rage
              pumping through Murdock’s veins. Castle could not, would not, go that route, but he can at least understand
              what it means to Hornhead.

              Still, their ideals, their adherence to their respective missions makes them too volatile to stay
              on one another’s good side for any period of time as these examples from their history illustrate
              in advance of their latest clash in DAREDEVIL/PUNISHER #2, available June 29.

          <h2>Silver surfer</h2>
          <p>
              Flying through space looking for planets for your master to eat might sound fun,
              but it likely doesn’t lead to a lot of “Friend” requests.

              The current SILVER SURFER series finds Galactus’ greatest herald exploring the galaxy with Dawn Greenwood,
              but before meeting her he usually soared alone. Usually, but not always—here’s a list of some of the
              Surfer’s best buddies from years past.
