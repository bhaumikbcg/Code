							<h2>To whomsoever it may concern</h2>
							<p>It gives me great pleasure to write this reccomendation for Bhaumik, who has a great knowledge of IT and Business fields even though he is from Electronics. In my association with Orion for 8 years, I've never worked with a fresher in designing team. Bhaumik changed this trend for Orion. When recruited he was the only fresher in designing team.</p>
							<p>I personally interviewed him for his technical skills and came to know that he knew a lot about programming languages than we had expected. We gave him a couple of designs to convert them to web pages and he did the job quite effortlessly. One aspect that impresses me most about Bhaumik, is his ability to adjust to changes in his work.</p>
							<p>Bhaumik always used to research on upcoming web development technologies and used to coordinate with scrum master and team lead to make sure he fully understood requirements of the clients. This characteristic of him is going to help hiim a lot for his future growth.</p>
							<p>He is a very dedicated person and never said no to learn new things. He learnt wordpress and bootstrap. He taught them to his juniors and would teach them various techniques and skills. He would always actively participate and place his ideas in the meetings and would communicate very nicely.</p>
							<p>Once I was given Orion's case reference project and my obvious choice was Bhaumik. He showed immense enthusiasm for this work. He easily managed everyone for this work. He completed the work of making 40 case reference files in 2 days. Within short span of beginning of his professional career, he had demonstrated exemplary professionalism and confidence.</p>

							<h2>To whomsoever it may concern</h2>
							<p>I've known Bhaumik for almost a year now. I have been his scrum master, so we have a regular interaction on daily basis, so I know him very well.</p>
							<p>He has deep liking for science, programming, business analytics and still has a twinkle in his eyes when we give him new program to solve. He himself has learned languages like HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, MySQL, C, C++ and python through online tutorials. Also most of the things he manages by himself.</p>
							<p>We had quite a work load and gave him minimal training, but he has managed everything by himself. He was put on three different companies' website design simultaneously, but he rose to the challenge, out performed new joinees by working extended hours. These characteristics, I considered to be the area of his future growth.</p><p>
His job was to convert PSD files to web pages, with increasing work and practise he became more and more proficient and his efficiency increased. He started finishing his work before time. He would very well convey his programming ideas to his team. He would never feel shy to express his views.</p>
<p>He has excellent written and verbal communication skills. I would place him among top 20% of his peers. With his delightful company, one can strike conversation on broad range of topics. He is humble and talks to everyone with great respect, be his senior or junior.</p>
