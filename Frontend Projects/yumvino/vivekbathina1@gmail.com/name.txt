Mr. Vivek
I have been drinking wine from a long time as it is tasteful and good for health. From up north in Mendocino and Lake County through Central Coast regions like Monterey and Paso Robles and down to SoCal wine hot spots like Temecula and San Diego county, I will give you the best reviews for the wineries you want to visit.
