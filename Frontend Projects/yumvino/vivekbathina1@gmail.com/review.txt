It was quite the ambiance. High ceilings, fireplaces galore, large windows. open kitchen area, and interesting seating in various rooms. It is an appointment only type of place. Though it was pretty full that afternoon when we arrived at 4:30, it had an intimate community feel.
This was our first time ever wine tasting and this place did not disappoint. We came here without reservations and even though they were busy, we were seated pretty fast.  I loved the interior of this place. Very open, high ceilings and had this rustic feel to it. (just gorgeous)
