I have been into wine tasting from years. My favourites are Red wine. It just gives you essence of love and warmth. Californiaâ€™s climate is ideal for producing rich, tannic and full-bodied Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Syrah wines, such as in the warm Napa Wine region, while the cooler coastal areas of Sonoma allow Pinot Noir and Chardonnay to excel.
